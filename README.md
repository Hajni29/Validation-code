# Validation-code
What is validation code in Java?

Validation code in Java is used to ensure that data adheres to certain rules, making it correct, complete, and appropriate before further processing or storage. This can include checking if fields are not empty, ensuring data types are correct, and validating formats such as email addresses.

Explanation:
validateName(String name): This method checks if the name is not null and not empty.
validateAge(int age): This method ensures that the age is a positive integer.
validateEmail(String email): This method uses a regular expression to verify that the email format is valid.
validateUser(String name, int age, String email): This method combines all individual validation methods to validate a user's input.
main(String[] args): This is the entry point of the program. It sets sample values for name, age, and email, and then validates them using the validateUser method.
Use Case:
You can use this validation code in various scenarios where user input needs to be validated, such as:

Forms in web applications
Command-line applications
Data processing systems
By implementing such validation checks, you can ensure that your application handles only valid data, which helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.
